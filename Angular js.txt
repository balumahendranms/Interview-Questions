Angular is front end framework, 
SIngle page application

end to end tooling
Code splitting
Angular cli 

How angular works
---------------------------------
First it will go to angular.json
main.ts - 
APP.MODULE.TS
APP.COMPONENT.TS
INDEX.HTML
APP.COMPONENT.HTML

DIRECTIVES

LAZY loading
--------------------------------
Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated. 
It improves the speed of the application load time by splitting the application into several bundles. 
When the user navigates through the app, the bundles are loaded as required.

.loadchildren

wildcard routing
------------------------------
if the page is not exist in the application,that time we need to show the page not found to the user.
We can achive by using path:** and component path 

routing
routelink
path :
componenet name :

Components in Angular

Life Cycle hooks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ngOnChanges: When an input/output binding value changes.
ngOnInit: After the first ngOnChanges.
ngDoCheck: Developer's custom change detection.
ngAfterContentInit: After component content initialized.
ngAfterContentChecked: After every check of component content.
ngAfterViewInit: After a component's views are initialized.
ngAfterViewChecked: After every check of a component's views.ngOnDestroy: Just before the component/directive is destroyed.
