Angular js
-------------------------------
Angular is front end framework, 
SIngle page application
Angular is written in typescript 
Its scalable web applications
Its a component based framework

Why Angular?
----------------------------------
Its uses the declarative templates
Dependency Injection
end to end tooling
Code splitting
Angular cli 

How angular works
---------------------------------
First it will go to angular.json
main.ts - 
APP.MODULE.TS
APP.COMPONENT.TS
INDEX.HTML
APP.COMPONENT.HTML

DIRECTIVES
---------------------------------------
directives is used to manipulate the dom
adding /removing the element from the dom

Using @directives we can create custom directives

Three directives

1.component directives
appcomponent

2.structural directives
ng-if
ng-for 
ng-switch

3.attribute directives
ng-class
ng-switch

LAZY loading
--------------------------------
Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated. 
It improves the speed of the application load time by splitting the application into several bundles. 
When the user navigates through the app, the bundles are loaded as required.

.loadchildren

wildcard routing
------------------------------
if the page is not exist in the application,that time we need to show the page not found to the user.
We can achive by using path:** and component path 

routing
routelink
path :
componenet name :

Components in Angular 
----------------------------
Components are building block of angular application.it contain the below items

@Component({
  selector: 'app-component-overview',
  templateUrl: './component-overview.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./component-overview.component.css']
})

selector
template
templateUrl
styleUrls

What is modules in angular
---------------------------
module is mechanism of group components, directives,pipes and services

Life Cycle hooks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ngOnChanges: When an input/output binding value changes.
ngOnInit: After the first ngOnChanges.
ngDoCheck: Developer's custom change detection.
ngAfterContentInit: After component content initialized.
ngAfterContentChecked: After every check of component content.
ngAfterViewInit: After a component's views are initialized.
ngAfterViewChecked: After every check of a component's views.ngOnDestroy: Just before the component/directive is destroyed.

pipes
----------
string pipes
lowercase
uppercase
titlecase
slice:3:5
json 
Pipes is filter it get a data as a input and transform as a desired output format.

Pure Pipe
-------------------
A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe
For eg:
@Pipe({
  name: 'filterPipe', 
  pure: true     
})
export class FilterPipe {}

Impure Pipe
------------------
An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameter(s) changes.
For eg:
@Pipe({
  name: 'filterPipe', 
  pure: false
})
export class FilterPipe
